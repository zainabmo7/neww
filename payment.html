<h2>payment methods</h2>
<br>
<p>After completing the work of your order through the site or application, or by communicating with the site's customer service team through conversation on the site,
 Facebook Messenger, Instagram, phone, email or any other means, you can pay using one of the following methods:<br><br></p>
 <h4>Paiement when recieving</h4>
 <br>
<p>
You can pay when you receive your order by paying in cash to the delivery representative
<br><br></p>
 <h4>Online payment</h4>
 <br>
<p>
 You can pay online using any international credit card<br><br>
</p>
<h2>delivery methods</h2>
<br>
<p>
 1-External orders must be paid in advance by the customer at the 4U_shopping.com/pay payment link,
 after completing the payment process, the order will be shipped outside Iraq.<br>
 2-Business days are all days of the week except Friday for the shopping department, the delivery department and most shipping companies,
 but the website receives your orders throughout the year without interruption, that is, in the case of an order, for example on Thursday,
 its delivery will be delayed perhaps an additional day because Friday is not a working day.<br>
 3-In the event of a request for several materials, part of which is in stock and the other part is not in stock, 
 the order will be delivered at the same time as the delivery period for the non-stocked materials.<br>
 4-In the event that some suppliers or merchants are late for processing,
 we will contact the customer to inform him of the delay by the merchant or supplier and ask the customer about his desire 
 to wait for the receipt of the material or not.
